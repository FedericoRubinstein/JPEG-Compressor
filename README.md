# JPEG Compressor
This project is a Java implementation of the JPEG lossy image compression algorithm.
Originally, it was a part of a larger academic project.
For more information about the JPEG compression algorithm, check out the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG).

## Usage

The only thing needed to execute the code is Java 8 or later.
The implementation transforms images with a .ppm extension to compressed files with a .comp extension and back. The main class instructs on how to do so. To obtain .ppm images you can use this [image conversor](https://convertio.co/es/jpg-ppm/).

## Examples
There is a [folder](test%20images) with 3 different test images:
* Lenna.ppm (512x512 pixels, 786.47 kB)
* flower_foveon.ppm (700x466 pixels, 978.62 kB)
* artificial.ppm (700x466 pixels, 978.62 kB)
